 static const char *__doc_gr_ft8_encoder = R"doc(<+description of block+>

Constructor Specific Documentation:

Return a shared_ptr to a new instance of ft8::encoder.

To avoid accidental use of raw pointers, ft8::encoder's constructor is in a private implementation class. ft8::encoder::make is the public interface for creating new instances.

Args:
    message : )doc";
